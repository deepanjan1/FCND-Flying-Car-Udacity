# FCND-Flying-Car-Nanodegree (Udacity)

The following folders contain the exercises and projects I've completed in Udacity's Flying Car Nanodegree.  

Each section provides a description of the projects and exercises.

## Project 1:  Backyard Flyer
This project has python code that was pulled from Udacity's [Github](https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Backyard-Flyer/).  The `backyard_flyer.py` was modified so that a drone within Udacity's similar or an actual PX4 drone can run a 10X10 meter square path mission.

## Lesson 2:  Planning As Search
This is a compilation of exercises done throughout the lesson to explore various path planning algorithms.  Links to each of the jupyter notebooks are below:
* [Breadth-First Search](https://github.com/deepanjan1/FCND-Flying-Car-Udacity/blob/master/FCND-Lesson2_1-Planning-As-Search/Breadth-First%20Search.ipynb):  This implements a breadth-first search algorithm on a 2-dimensional surface.  We then plot the path taken to illustrate the Breadth-First Search algorithm.
