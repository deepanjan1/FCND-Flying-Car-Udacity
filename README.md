# FCND-Flying-Car-Nanodegree (Udacity)

The following folders contain the exercises and projects I've completed in Udacity's Flying Car Nanodegree.  

Each section provides a description of the projects and exercises.

## Project 1:  Backyard Flyer
This project has python code that was pulled from Udacity's [Github](https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Backyard-Flyer/).  The `backyard_flyer.py` was modified so that a drone within Udacity's similar or an actual PX4 drone can run a 10X10 meter square path mission.

## Lesson 2:  Planning As Search
This is a compilation of exercises done throughout the lesson to explore various path planning algorithms.  Boiler plate code is included from Udacity and the following are the modified versions to complete the objective (articulated below).  
* [Breadth-First Search](https://github.com/deepanjan1/FCND-Flying-Car-Udacity/blob/master/FCND-Lesson2_1-Planning-As-Search/Breadth-First%20Search.ipynb):  This implements a breadth-first search algorithm on a 2-dimensional surface.  We then plot the path taken to illustrate the Breadth-First Search algorithm.
* [Cost-First Search](https://github.com/deepanjan1/FCND-Flying-Car-Udacity/blob/master/FCND-Lesson2_1-Planning-As-Search/Uniform%20Cost%20Search.ipynb):  This implements a uniform cost search algorithm.  Each grid cell on this 2-dimensional surface has a cost of 1.  The path is found and then illustrated as well.
